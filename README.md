### How the Analysis Works

LegalWhiz uses a pattern-matching approach to identify potentially risky clauses:

1. **Pattern Identification**: Regular expressions match common legal language patterns
2. **Context Extraction**: The full clause context is extracted, not just the matched text
3. **Risk Scoring**: Each clause is scored based on specific risk factors and language
4. **Summary Generation**: Key points are extracted from the document for a high-level overview
5. **Q&A Processing**: Questions are parsed and relevant document sections are extracted for answers

## üìã Risk Categories

LegalWhiz identifies and explains these common risky contract elements:

- **Auto-renewal** - Clauses that automatically extend your contract
- **Termination penalties** - Fees for ending the contract early
- **Liability limitations** - Restrictions on the other party's responsibility
- **Indemnification** - Requirements to defend the other party from claims
- **Non-compete** - Restrictions on future business activities
- **Intellectual property rights** - Who owns the work product
- **Jurisdiction and governing law** - Where disputes must be resolved
- **Dispute resolution** - How conflicts are handled (arbitration, etc.)
- **Change of terms** - Ability to modify contract terms unilaterally
- **Late payment penalties** - Extra charges for missing payment deadlines
- **Minimum commitment** - Required spending regardless of usage
- **Data usage and privacy** - How your information can be used

## ü§î FAQ

**Q: Does LegalWhiz send my contract data to any external services?**  
A: No. All analysis happens locally on your machine. Your documents never leave your computer.

**Q: Is LegalWhiz a substitute for legal advice?**  
A: No. While LegalWhiz can help identify potential issues in contracts, it's not a substitute for professional legal counsel. Always consult with a qualified attorney for legal advice.

**Q: What file formats are supported?**  
A: Currently, LegalWhiz supports PDF and DOCX (Microsoft Word) formats.

**Q: How accurate is the analysis?**  
A: LegalWhiz uses pattern matching to identify potential issues, but it may miss some clauses or incorrectly identify others. Always review the full contract carefully.

## üîß Customization

You can customize the risk patterns in `openai_analyzer.py` by modifying the `RISK_CATEGORIES` dictionary. Add new patterns or adjust existing ones to better match the types of contracts you typically review.

## üíº Use Cases

- **Small Business Owners**: Review service agreements before signing
- **Freelancers**: Check client contracts for unfavorable terms
- **Startups**: Analyze vendor agreements quickly without legal costs
- **Legal Teams**: Initial screening of contracts to focus review efforts
- **Individuals**: Better understand rental agreements, terms of service, etc.
